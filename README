## News
2011.10.06 Great! The SEED reachs the first milestone, M0.

## Overview

The basic motivation is to drive the design and implementation of SEED to match the requirements of the professional Scala Developers.

## Get started

I have written one blog entry, which gives an introduction into the SEED M0:

## Road Map

## Contribute

For the clear architecture, it is easy and fun to contribute to SEED. The informal prerequisite is the basic knowledge of Java, Scala, Eclipse and/or OSGI. But you can contribute anything even if you are not a programmer.

Let's say about the feature of "Mark Occurrences", it could be implemented by adding a new token based occurrences detection service (like IFetchOccurrencesService) by consuming the LexingService as the backend. As for the frontend(UI), you can mock my token highlighting logic firstly. Or it is better to abstract one token based rendering service for all kinds of things in the future. It may cost hours or days which depends on what you want to do and how much you are familiar with the Eclipse platform. 

I will be very glad to see your name here:

## Additional resources

for time limitation, it needs a little time to setup a group or other communication channel for sharing ideas. If you have some ideas before these channels setup, you can tell me via jin.phd@gmail.com.
